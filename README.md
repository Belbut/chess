## What I Learned

This project became much more than an exercise â€” it was a deep dive into software design and thoughtful engineering. I deliberately overengineered the structure, not out of necessity, but to sharpen my skills, experiment with ideas, and learn how to balance elegance with maintainability.

- Crafted a **modular OOP architecture** to manage complex, interdependent Chess rules and board states.
- Leveraged **Procs and Lambdas** to create flexible, reusable logic blocks for key rule validations (like movement restrictions, checks, and pins).
- Integrated **Stockfish**, allowing players to face off against a grandmaster-level AI, and managed external engine communication.
- Practiced **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using **RSpec**, focusing test coverage on critical gameplay logic and input validation.
- Set up **custom Git hooks**:
  - Spellcheck enforcement before commits
  - Commit message standardization using **Commitlint**
- Refined debugging workflows using **IRB**, **Pry**, and **VS Code Debugger**, especially helpful in inspecting complex game state transitions.
- Gained insight into the importance of keeping code readable and modular, especially in large logic-heavy projects like Chess.

There are still parts of the code Iâ€™d like to refactor or improve â€” things I know I could make cleaner or simply implement in a more elegant way. And honestly, Iâ€™d probably enjoy doing it. But at this point, I realized the time and effort it would take wouldnâ€™t really move the needle in terms of what Iâ€™d learn from it. So Iâ€™ve decided to leave the project as it is â€” and truthfully, Iâ€™m pretty happy with how it turned out.
